<h3><b>&bull; Earlier Reionization in Regions around UV-luminous Galaxies</b></h3>
<img class="center" src="./research_files/Boosted_T_IGM.png" alt="[T_IGM]" width=678px/>
<p>
Using the combined spectroscopic dataset of HST grism and Keck DEIMOS+MOSFIRE observations of 275 reionization-era galaxies, we constrained Lyman-alpha equivalent-width (EW) distribution at z > 6 as a function of UV luminosity. 
We provided the empirical measurements of the IGM transmission, defined as the relative ratio of observed-to-expected (or intrinsic) EWs of Lyman-alpha. 
We found that the IGM transmission appears to be higher for the UV-luminous galaxies, suggesting that reionization proceeds faster in regions around such galaxies (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933...87J">Jung et al. 2022a, ApJ, 933, 87</a>). 
This observational finding is consistent with theoretical predictions on Lyman-alpha transmission in the IGM from reionization simulations (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..263P">Park, <b>IJ</b> et al. 2021, ApJ, 922, 263</a>). 
The theoretical study shows that UV-luminous galaxies tend to reside in “ionized bubbles” as they ionize large volumes and are located in overdense regions, making it easier for Lyman-alpha photons to escape.

<h3><b>&bull; Texas Spectroscopic Search for Lyman-alpha Emission at the End of Reionization</b></h3>
<img class="center" src="./research_files/TexasSurvey.png" alt="[Lya_Survey]" width=678px/>
<p>
My doctoral thesis at the University of Texas at Austin, entitled “<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.26153/tsw/11232"><i>Constraining the End of Reionization with Lyman-alpha Spectroscopy</i></a>,” was a pioneering study that utilized Lyman-alpha emission to map the ionization state of the IGM during reionization. 
I performed statistical analyses on their Lyman-alpha emission properties by analyzing spectroscopic observations of distant galaxies. 
This work led to a series of publications in the Astrophysical Journal, developing a method to estimate the neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM, discovering new Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at the highest redshifts, and advancing our understanding of the timeline and topology of reionization (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...864..103J">Jung et al. 2018, ApJ, 864, 103</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877..146J">Jung et al. 2019, ApJ, 877, 146</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904..144J">Jung et al.. 2020, ApJ, 904, 144</a>).

<h3><b>&bull; A Spatially-Resolved Stellar Population Study Using the HST Imaging: Reduced star-formation rates in the centers of massive galaxies at z = 4</b></h3>
<img class="center" src="./research_files/Reduced_SFR.png" alt="[Reduced_SFR]" width=600px/>
<p>
In the PhD program at the University of Texas at Austin, I have dealt with the Hubble Space Telescope imaging data for studying spatially-resolved star formation histories of distant galaxies, which was published, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...834...81J"><i>Evidence for Reduced Specific Star Formation Rates in the Centers of Massive Galaxies at z = 4 (Jung et al. 2017, ApJ, 834, 81)</i></a>. 
In this work, I developed my own galaxy spectral energy distribution fitting IDL procedure based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and performed a spatially-resolved stellar population study of z = 4 galaxies. 
A key discovery of the study is that the galaxies with the highest central mass densities have reduced star formation in their centers, possibly observing the earliest phases of bulge formation.

During my master's program, I studied the theoretical understanding of galaxy evolution using N-body simulations and a semi-analytic model with Prof. Sukyoung K. Yi at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. 
Particularly, I developed a dark matter (DM) halo merger tree builder, called <em>ySAMtm</em>, which constructs DM halo merger trees from cosmological N-body simulations and provides a DM halo backbone for the semi-analytic model of Prof. Yi's group (ySAM; Lee & Yi, 2013). Jung et al. (2014) also study large-scale environmental effects on galaxy assembly by analyzing the semi-analytic model galaxies.
