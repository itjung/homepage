I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). Prior to joining STScI, I held a JWST postdoc position at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Astrophysics Science Division, Code 665).</br>
</p>

<p>
My area of expertise is in observational astronomy, where I study galaxies in the early universe and reionization. Specifically, I focus on the Lyman-alpha emission properties both observationally and theoretically. My research aims to advance the use of Lyman-alpha as a probe of reionization and expand our knowledge of the detailed process of reionization. I received my PhD in Astronomy from the University of Texas at Austin. My doctoral thesis was titled "Constraining the End of Reionization with Lyman-alpha Spectroscopy." During my doctoral studies and postdoctoral research, I discovered new Lyman-alpha emitters at the highest redshifts, developed an innovative method to constrain the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM) from analyses of Lyman-alpha, and advanced our understanding of the timeline and topology of reionization.</br>
</p>

<p>
I am originally from South Korea. I obtained my Bachelor's (astronomy & physics) and Master's (astronomy) degrees at Yonsei University in Seoul before joining the UT Austin astronomy program where I earned my PhD in August 2019. 
During my Master's program, I worked on building dark matter halo merger trees from cosmological N-body simulations and investigating large-scale environmental effects on galaxies using a semi-analytic model.
